<p>Who influenced what band? Which bands have shared members? Which musicians have collaborated? Which bands have beef? All that and more is being recorded here.</p>
<br>
<p>WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?</p>
<p>This is a space to dump my love for music. I love learning about the interconnectedness of the music world, including who influenced who, who's been in what bands, who's worked together, who's sampled who, all that stuff.
I've always thought it would be cool to create a giant network graph to connect as many bands and musicians as I can think of.
This comes with a caveat: I don't know much about coding, so for now I'm using some free resources, such as code from vis.js.</p>
<br>
<p>HOW DOES IT WORK?</p>
<p>Right now, it's pretty simple. Band 1 and band 2 are listed as nodes. The edges (connecting lines) indicate how those two bands have some degree of connection. You can hover over the nodes or the edges to read more information.
Eventually, it would be cool to create more in-depth pop-ups, or even pages for each band that list their connections. I'd also like to get into fact-checking and including sources to create a more accurate compendium. But for now, this is just me experimenting with a concept.
I'm trying color-code the nodes into genres and subgenres. The edges are also color-coded based on the type of connection.</p>
